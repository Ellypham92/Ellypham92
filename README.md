 🌱 I feel fascinated for the unique combination of logic and technology in Data Analytics. I am excited by the process of finding meaningful insights from raw data. 
-  I am pursuing a Master of Science in Data Analytics degree at University of Houston-Downtown
- 💞️ When not working with data I travel, dance, garden and read books. I have visited over 10 countries, and 5 States in the US
