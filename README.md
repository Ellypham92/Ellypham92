- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ellypham, working in Houston, TX
- 🌱 I am pursuing a Master of Science in Data Analytics degree at University of Houston-Downtown
- 👀 I love data
- 📫 To talk and share good books about data, reach me via [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elly-pham-15018193/)
- 💞️ When not working with data I travel, dance, garden and read books. I have visited over 10 countries, and 5 States in the US
