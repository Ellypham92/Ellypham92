- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ellypham, working in Houston, TX
- 🌱 I am pursuing a Master of Science in Data Analytics degree at University of Houston-Downtown
- 👀 I love data
- 📫 To talk about data, feel free to reach me via [linkedin][*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elly-pham-15018193/)
- 💞️ When not working with data, I travel, dance and read books. I have visited over 10 countries, and 5 States in the US. Add my [instargram](https://www.instagram.com/ellyppham/) to join me in traveling adventure
